.. note::
   Thanks to the `Localization Lab <https://www.localizationlab.org/>`_ and our great volunteer community, the software is already available and continuously made available in a lot of languages. This aspect of internationalization is crucial in many projects. In case you are starting a project and the required languages are not available we strongly invite you to register on our `web translation platform <https://www.transifex.com/otf/globaleaks/>`_ offered by `Transifex <https://www.transifex.com/otf/globaleaks/>`_ and support yourself the translation. Internationalization and Localization is in fact are crucial for the success of a whistleblowing project. Thank you!
