Security Audits
===============
GlobaLeaks is periodically subject to independent security audits in order to verify and improve the security of the system and this page lists the most important available reports.

We try to get it audited at least every 2 years thanks to funding opportinities and each adopter is invited to contribute funding a new general or topic specific audit based on their possibilities in order to ensure every alghorithm, component and methodology applied within the project is properly verified.

If you have carried or have the possibility to sponsor a security audit please email us at `info@globaleaks.org <mailto:info@globaleaks.org>`_. This would be particularly important for the general software security. When asking a company to audit the software please always remember to ask for the possibility to ask for the possibility to publish the report before this is performed; many auditors in fact may dont agree with publishing afterwards and this happened many times with waste of project resources.

If you are an independent security auditor or during your own peer review of globaleaks you have or think to have found a vulnerability, please do not file a public issue but send us your report privately either via or reporting form at https://github.com/globaleaks/GlobaLeaks/security/advisories/new or via email at `security@globaleaks.org <mailto:security@globaleaks.org>`_.
