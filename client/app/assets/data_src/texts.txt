The code is either invalid or expired.
The connection is not secure.
The following recipients will receive your report and could not be deselected:
The following step-by-step procedure will guide you through creating your whistleblowing platform.
The link will expire in 7 days.
The manual configuration wizard will guide you through the setup of HTTPS from an alternative Certificate Authority.
The new password must be different from the current one.
The platform is still not configured for HTTPS connections and should therefore only be used for testing purposes.
The platform must be reachable through a public IP address and the selected hostname must have a DNS record referencing that address.
The platform supports the configuration of HTTPS through this interface.
The provided recovery key is invalid.
The provided reset token is invalid or expired.
The receipt is either invalid or the report has expired.
The specified input is not valid.
The specified input is not valid:
The specified old password is not valid
The two passwords do not match
The upload request exceeds the size limit
The user will be forced to change its password on next login.
The validation link is either incorrect or has expired.
The whistleblower has already read the last update
The whistleblower has not read the last update yet
Then, copy and paste the following address into the Tor Browser:
This custom text is no longer displayed on the platform. The original text has either changed or been removed.

Warning
We advise selecting this option if you would like to protect data from being lost in the situation where recipients lose their passwords. On the other hand, we would not advise using this feature if you want to setup a system where only recipients are able to access submissions.
We recommend that you access the “Preferences” section in order to retrieve your “Account Recovery Key” and store it safely. This key will be necessary to recover your access to the platform and to your data in case you forget your password.
We will try to get back to you as soon as possible.
